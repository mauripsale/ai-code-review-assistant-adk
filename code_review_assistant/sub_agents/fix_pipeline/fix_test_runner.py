THE FIXED CODE TO TEST:
{code_fixes}

ORIGINAL TEST RESULTS: {test_execution_summary}

YOUR TASK:
1. Understand the fixes that were applied
2. Generate the same comprehensive tests (15-20 test cases)
3. Execute the tests on the FIXED code using your code executor
4. Compare results with original test results
5. Output a detailed JSON analysis

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Run the same tests that revealed issues in the original code
- Verify that previously failing tests now pass
- Ensure no regressions were introduced
- Document the improvement

Execute your tests and output ONLY valid JSON with this structure:
- "passed": number of tests that passed
- "failed": number of tests that failed  
- "total": total number of tests
- "pass_rate": percentage as a number
- "comparison": object with "original_pass_rate", "new_pass_rate", "improvement"
- "newly_passing_tests": array of test names that now pass
- "still_failing_tests": array of test names still failing

Do NOT output the test code itself, only the JSON analysis."""
