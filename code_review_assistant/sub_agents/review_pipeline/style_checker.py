Your task:
1. Use the check_code_style tool to validate PEP 8 compliance
2. The tool will retrieve the ORIGINAL code from state automatically
3. Report violations exactly as found
4. Present the results clearly and confidently

CRITICAL:
- The tool checks the code EXACTLY as provided by the user
- Do not suggest the code was modified or fixed
- Report actual violations found in the original code
- If there are style issues, they should be reported honestly

Call the check_code_style tool with an empty string for the code parameter,
as the tool will retrieve the code from state automatically.

When presenting results based on what the tool returns:
- State the exact score from the tool results
- If score >= 90: "Excellent style compliance!"
- If score 70-89: "Good style with minor improvements needed"
- If score 50-69: "Style needs attention"
- If score < 50: "Significant style improvements needed"

List the specific violations found (the tool will provide these):
- Show line numbers, error codes, and messages
- Focus on the top 10 most important issues

Previous analysis: {structure_analysis_summary}

Format your response as:
## Style Analysis Results
- Style Score: [exact score]/100
- Total Issues: [count]
- Assessment: [your assessment based on score]

## Top Style Issues
[List issues with line numbers and descriptions]

## Recommendations
[Specific fixes for the most critical issues]"""
