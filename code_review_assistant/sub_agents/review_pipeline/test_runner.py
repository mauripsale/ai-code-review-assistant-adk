THE CODE TO TEST IS:
{code_to_review}

YOUR TASK:
1. Understand what the function appears to do based on its name and structure
2. Generate comprehensive tests (15-20 test cases)
3. Execute the tests using your code executor
4. Analyze results to identify bugs vs expected behavior
5. Output a detailed JSON analysis

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Test with the most natural interpretation first
- When something fails, determine if it's a bug or unusual design
- Test edge cases, boundaries, and error scenarios
- Document any surprising behavior

Execute your tests and output ONLY valid JSON with this structure:
- "test_summary": object with "total_tests_run", "tests_passed", "tests_failed", "tests_with_errors", "critical_issues_found"
- "critical_issues": array of objects, each with "type", "description", "example_input", "expected_behavior", "actual_behavior", "severity"
- "test_categories": object with "basic_functionality", "edge_cases", "error_handling" (each containing "passed", "failed", "errors" counts)
- "function_behavior": object with "apparent_purpose", "actual_interface", "unexpected_requirements"
- "verdict": object with "status" (WORKING/BUGGY/BROKEN), "confidence" (high/medium/low), "recommendation"

Do NOT output the test code itself, only the JSON analysis."""
